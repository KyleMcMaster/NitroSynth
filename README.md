# NitroSynth

A simple synthesizer plugin built with JUCE.

## Notable Project Files

## Build Instructions

### Prerequisites

- JUCE

## Debugging and Testing

Currently, I have the build path added to FL Studio's plugin scanner and I can see the plugin in the list of available plugins. This allows me to iterate on the plugin and test it in FL Studio. This should be possible with Logic Pro X and Ableton Live as well.

I also could build the plugin host example project and initialize it as the startup project for debugging. This would allow me to debug the plugin in a standalone environment. In my "backlog" as a TODO once I have more complex features implemented.
